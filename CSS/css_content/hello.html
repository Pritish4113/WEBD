    <!-- now there are 2 ways of using css, first by using style tag, like we used below -->
    <style>
        body{
            /* body is the whole background  */
            background-color: yellow;
        }
        #first{
            /* "#" is used for targetting ids */
            background-color: orange;
        }
        .bg2{
            /* "." is used for targetting classes */
            background-color: black;
            color: white;
        }
    </style>

    <!-- the second way of using css is by making .css file and importing it here (use link:css) -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<body>
    <!-- ids have to be unique, however classes can be used multiple numbers of times  -->
    <div id="first">
        this is id = first

    <div id="second">
        this is id = second

    <section class="red bg1">
        this is class = red
    </section>
    <section class="blue bg2"> 
        this is class = blue and bg
        <!-- here above there are 2 classes that is blue and bg -->
